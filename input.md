THE CONCEPT OF NIRV ĀṆA AND THE PATH LEADING TO NIRV ĀṆA 
(ACCORDING TO PALI BUDDHISM ) 
INTRO DUCTION  
The Historical Buddha taught only suffering ( dukkha ) and its cessation. He started 
his teaching by defining the state of suffering  and making us aware how our mind s 
are flaming with immoral roots and lives are burning  with old age, sickness, and 
death. How ever, he discovered a gradual path through which one  can introspect 
oneself and with the comprehension of suffering as it is, seeks liberation from 
transmigration ( saṃs āra). He announced that the taste of this (his) teaching is 
release . This release, emancipation, liberation and freedom from suffering is 
known as Nirv āṇa (P āli: Nibb āna) or the “highest bliss”  (paramaṃ sukhaṃ ). It is 
well preached in the third of the classic formula of fourfold noble truth.  
This module is divided into two parts. In the first part we will discuss the nature 
of Nibb āna according to P āli Buddhism. In the second part we will deal with the 
nature of the path leading to Nibb āna. 
I. THE NATURE OF NIBBĀNA 
The attainment of Nibb āna is the ultimate goal of Buddha’s fourfold saṅgha. It is 
both a concept and an experience. The Buddhist teaching of Nibb āna is one of the 
most discussed and widely interpreted concepts among monastics and 
academicians. However, we do not have a concrete de finition as such . It is the 
supramundane ( lokuttara ) experience  that is  very difficult to express through 
language and words.  It is lokuttara  in the sense that it crosses over ( uttarati ) the 
world ( loka). Nevertheless, we will see how the concept has been understood in 
the P āli canon and commentaries.  
The Buddha never encouraged his followers to get into the metaphysical 
discussions. He said it is better to practice instead of irrelevant discussions that 
obstruct the path leading to liberation. It is worth mentioning, here, that the P āli 
canon presents ten undetermined ( abyākata) metaphysical questions to which the 
Buddha remained silent  as they were nothing but the thickets of theoretical views  2 (diṭṭhigahanaṃ ). They are: (1 -2:) Is the world ( loka) eternal or non -eternal? (3 -
4:) Is the world finite or in finite? (5 -6:) Is the self ( jīva) same as body or different 
from body? (7 -10:) Does the Tath āgata exist after death, or does not exist,  or both 
or neither?  In this regard, the parable of the poisoned arrow (MN 63) deserves 
attention.  
"It's just as  if a man were wounded with an arrow thickly smeared with poison. 
His friends & companions, kinsmen & relatives would provide him with a 
surgeon, and the man would say, 'I won't have this arrow removed until I know 
the social status of  the ma n who wounded me,  until I know the given name & 
clan and the bodily features  of the man and the region from where he comes; until 
I know the particulars of the bow, bowstring, the shaft and the feathers of the shaft 
with which I was wounded. The man woul d die and those things would still 
remain unknown to him. ”  
DEFINITION AND MEANING OF NIBBĀNA 
The literal meaning of the term Nibb āna is “blowing out” or “ to be extinguished” 
as it is derived from the verb nibbāti. Here, it signifies the extinction from 
threefold unwholesome roots —attachment ( rāga), hatred ( dosa ) and delusion 
(moha ). Again, the term Nibb āna is understood by its two components parts: ni 
and vāna. The term v āna can be derived with two verbal roots: vu (to weave) 
and vā (to blow). It is called Nibb āna as it is a departure ( ni) from the cord -like 
(vāna) craving.  [AbhiS; ch.VI, Rūpaparicchedo, Nibb ānabhedo ] 
Ācārya Buddhaghosa in his magnum opus the Visuddhimagga [ch. XXI] states 
that a true meditator ( yogāvacara ) longs for Nibb āna by calming the eleven types 
of fires, which cause rebirth.  [Vism, ch. XXI]  They are — greed ( rāga), hatred 
(dosa ), delusion ( moha ), birth ( jāti), aging ( jarā), death ( maraṇa ), sorrow  (soka), 
lamentation ( parideva ), pain ( dukkha ), grief ( domanassa ), and despair ( upāyāsa). 
However, the text Abhidhamm āvatāra clearly states that Nibb āna is not mere 
extinction of these fires but it is only the means to attain Nibb āna, and is not an 
end in itself . (cf. Narada 1987, 357)  
We find several connotations of the Nibb āna-state and a few synonyms as stated 
in the Tipiṭaka. The Brahmay ācanakath ā of Vinaya -Piṭaka records that the 
perfectly enlightened one declares that what he has attained (Nibb āna) is 
profound, hard to comprehend, peaceful, excellent, far beyond mere int ellectual 
reasoning, subtle, only to be realised by the wise.  Again, in the Ariyapariyesan ā-
sutta  (MN 26), the Buddha while defining the noble quest describes Nibb āna as 
unborn, unageing, unnailing, deathless, sorrowless, undefiled, the supreme and  3 attaine d by the best exertion  (AN 4.255) . Ācariya Anuruddha in the 
Abhidhammatthasaṅgaho  describes the state of Nibb āna with four adjectives. He 
states that the great sages who are liberated from craving declare  that Nibb āna is 
a state which is deathless  (accutaṃ ), absolutely endless  (accantaṃ ), 
unconditioned  (asaṅkhataṃ ), and unsurpassed  (anuttaraṃ ). Moreover, it is the 
stilling of all formations, the relinquishing of all attachments, the destruction of 
craving, dispassion, and cessation  (MN 26 168) . With all the se descriptions it is 
very clear that the third noble truth, the cessation of suffering is Nibb āna. 
Although, the term Nibb āna is not mentioned in the description of dukkhanirodha  
in the Nik āya, the Nirodhasacca -niddesava ṇṇanā of the commentary of Vibhaṅga  
states—Nibb āna, which has one meaning only: “ that which is the remainderless 
fading away and cessation of craving, giving it up, relinquishing it, letting it go, 
not relying on it .” 
The Milindapañho  also discusses about the state, the realization, and the place of 
Nibb āna (Pesala 1991, 155 -159). It states that Nibb āna is:  
 Entirely blissful  and there is no un -satisfactoriness mixed in it  
 The attribute of Nibb āna is understood by the similes of lotus,  water, medicine, 
great ocean, food, space, wish -fulfilling gems, red sandalwood, butter, and  
mountain peak.  It is not polluted by the defilements like a lotus is not wetted with 
water; extinguishes the thirst of craving like the water chills the fever o f 
defilements; nourishes like nectar as the medicine cures the beings from poison; 
it is empty of defilements like the ocean is empty of corpse; and so on;  
 It is free from the three periods of time: past, present, and future; neither arisen, 
nor non -arisen , nor producible;  
 The element of Nibb āna does exist and can be realised by the one who truly 
understands the formations as per the instruction of the Buddha with the faculty 
of wisdom; It  is to be known by the freedom from distress, danger, and fear, by 
peace, by bliss, by happiness, by purity and by coolness. Nibb āna is like getting 
out of the fire; getting out of the pit; coming out of trouble; getting out of the mud; 
the world is like a n iron -ball; and like a stray person takes the right path.  
There is no spot, where the Nibb āna is situated. However, one can realise 
anywhere —whether in Greek, in China, in Benaras, in Gandhara, in the highest 
heaven, mountain’s top and so on — with careful  attention (yoniso manasik āro) 
with a firm grounding in morality.  
NIBBĀNA: ONEFOLD , TWOFOLD AND THREEFOLD   4 Nibb āna is onefold by the way of intrinsic nature (sabh āvato). It is said to be 
peaceful ( santi ). As such it is unique ( kevala ); exclusively supramundane and 
undifferentiated ultimate reality. It is supposed to be realised by oneself 
(paccattam veditabbo ). 
Since the state of Nibb āna is attainable in this very life and after the passing away 
of an Arahant , the Buddha spoke the twofold Nibb āna ca lled the Nibb āna element 
with the residue remaining ( sopādhisesa ) and the Nibb āna element without the 
residue remaining ( anup ādhisesa ). These two states are known as kilesa -
parinibb āna and khandha -parinibb āna in the P āli commentaries  (VibhA 433) . 
Here, one  may understand thus: the former element indicates the Nibb āna state of 
the Buddha what he attained at Bodhgaya and the later element represents his 
attainment at Kus īnārā in between the two S āla trees. For the Sop ādhisesa 
Nibb āna i.e. the experience of Ni bbāna in this very life is defined by various 
modern scholars such as Walpola Rahula (2007), Damien Kewon (2000), Rupert 
Gethin (1998), and Ajhan Sucitto (2010) in many ways. For instance, it is 
peaceful, free from negative mental states, no sensation itse lf is happiness, and 
non-reactive. The attainment of  Anup ādhisesa Nibb āna dh ātu means the final and 
full departure from any conditioned state. Being free from the cycle of existence, 
an Arahant  knows and sees only the cessation of the process but not the death of 
anything that pertains to the concept of me, mine and myself. The state of 
Anup ādhisesa Nibb āna, however, is difficult to express; it falls under the category 
of undetermined  (abyākata) questions  (7-10). 
It is threefold by the way of different aspects ( ākārabhedena ). They are void 
(suññataṃ ), signless ( animittaṃ ), and longing -free ( appaṇihitaṃ ). It is void as it 
is devoid of all conditioned states such as greed, hatred, and delusion. Ācārya 
Buddhaghosa in the Vism explains how ultimately all the truths are said to be 
void. He states they are void in a sense of the absence of anyone who experiences, 
any doer, anyone who is extinguished, and any goer. I quote:  
For there is suffering, but no ne who suffers;  
Doing exists although there is no doer.  
Extinction is but no extinguished person;  
Although there is a path, there is no goer.   
[Ñāṇamoli  2011, 529]  
Nibb āna is not void here; it is realized as one of the mental objects 
(vatthudhamma ), decidedly proving that it is not a state of nothingness. In the  5 same way being free from the signs and hankering of all conditioned states it is 
called signless and longing -free,  respectively.  
II. THE PATH LEADING TO NIBBĀNA 
Therav āda school strictly follows the gradual process of liberation. It says a 
practitioner, through a gradual path, discovers such a state which is already 
existing. There is a gradual path that leads to Nibb āna but the Nibb āna is not 
produced by the path. Bhikkhu  Bodhi rightly says : you  may get to the mountain 
along a path, but the mountain is not the result, not an effect of the path. You may 
see a light, but the light is not the result of your eyesight. Nibb āna is truth, the 
suchness, one can only realise it. On e cannot bring Nibb āna into existence. 
Therefore, it is not the result of anything; has no cause and effect. It is asaṅkhata  
as it is free from the threefold characteristics —arising ( uppāda), cessation ( vaya ), 
and change of state ( ṭhitassa  aññathattaṃ )—of any conditioned belongs to the 
mundane and supramundane state. (AN 3.47)  
The Buddha, in the first sermon, declared the eightfold path called the middle 
way, which leads to disenchantment ( nibbid āya), dispassion ( virāgāya), cessation 
(nirodh āya), calming ( upasam āya), direct knowledge ( abhiññ āya), self -
awakening ( sambodh āya), and Unbinding ( nibbānāya).  (SN 56.11)  
This path is called middle path (majjhim ā paṭipad ā) as it avoids the two extremes. 
In P āli literature, they represent indulgence to the sensual passion 
(kāmesuk āmasukkhallik ānuyogo ) and self -mortification ( attakilamath ānuyogo ). 
These two extremes or the theoretical views also represent the theory of eternalism 
(sassatav āda) and annihilationism (ucchedav āda). Psychologically, Karunadasa 
(2013) rightly observes that for the belief in an eternal self is due to craving for 
being ( bhavataṇh ā)  and the belief in a temporary self is due to craving for non -
being ( vibhavataṇh ā).  
Here, middle path means the practice of eightfold path or the dependent 
origination through which one avoids the both extremes: spiritual eternalism and 
materialist annihilationism. The eightfold path consists of: right view  (samm ā 
diṭṭhi ), right intension  (samm ā saṅkappo ), right  speech  (samm ā vācā), right action  
(samm ā kammanto ), right livelihood  (samm ā ājīvo), right effort  (samm ā vāyāmo), 
right mindfulness  (samm ā sati), and right concentration  (samm ā samādhi). Here 
the first two limbs of the path belong to the practice of wisdom  (paññ ā), the last 
two represent concentration ( samādhi) and the remaining four limbs  being the  
ground supporting factor s for concentration and wisdom constitute  the practice of  6 virtue ( sīla). These three factors are technically called threefold training 
(tisikkh ā): virtue, concentration, and wisdom.  
The P āli canon suggests several other approaches or the way s of attaining 
liberation that include:  
 Samatha and Vipassan ā meditation [AN 4.170 ];  
 freeing oneself one’s ceased mind of restlessness concerning the dhamma [AN 
4.170 ];  
 through jhāna-s 
 the fourfold establishment of mindfulness  (Cattāro satipa ṭṭhānā)[MN 10 ];  
 seven stages of Purification (satta -visuddhi ) as depicted in MN 24 and the Vism.  
If we minutely see the structure of these references, we find that Nibb āna is 
attainable through threefold training only i.e., virtue ( sīla), concentration 
(samādhi), and wisdom ( paññ ā). These three pillars of Buddhism can be 
understood with several verse s including the following three:  
Avoidance all evil, gathering of merit  and purifying one’s own  mind  —this is 
teaching of the Buddhas . [Dhp 183; Sarao 2009, 140]  
(sabbap āpassa  akaraṇaṃ  kusalassa  upasampad ā sacittapariyodapanaṃ 
etaṃ  buddh āna sāsanaṃ ).  
When a wise man, established well in virtue, develops consciousness and 
understanding, then as a bhikkhu  ardent  and sagacious, succeeds in disentangling 
this tangle. (SN 1.23; Ñ āṇamoli 2011, 4)  
(sīle patiṭṭh āya naro  sapañño,  
cittaṃ  paññañca  bhāvayaṃ.  
ātāpī nipako  bhikkhu,  
so imaṃ  vijaṭaye  jaṭanti. ) 
Morality, concentration, wisdom, and release  have been comprehended  by the 
illustrious Gotama  himself . Having known them directly, he taught the Dhamma 
to the bhikkhus. The awakened one  who is  the end -maker of suffering, the One 
with vision, has attained Nibbāna . (AN 4.1)  
(sīlaṃ samādhi paññ ā ca, 
vimutti  ca anuttar ā. 
anubuddh ā ime dhamm ā, 
gotamena  yasassin ā. 
iti buddho  abhiññ āya,  7 dhammamakkh āsi bhikkhunaṃ.  
dukkhassantakaro  satth ā, 
cakkhum ā parinibbuto. ) 
Since the state of Nibb āna is beyond worldly comprehension, it is supramundane, 
the four preceding stages to Arahatship or Nibb āna are worth mentioning.  A 
practitioner who is qualified in mundane concentration ( lokiya sam ādhi) has 
suppressed the five hindrances ( nīvaraṇa ) of samādhi through the five jhāna-
factor - initial application ( vitakka ), sustained application ( vicāra), pleasure ( pīti), 
happiness ( sukha ) and one-pointedness concentration ( ekaggat ā) and successfully 
compreh ends the four immaterial states of infinite space, infinite consciousness, 
nothingness, and neither -perception -nor-non-perception enters to the 
supramundane state. Having been qualified in the immaterial state, here, the 
practitioner recognises ten negativ e mental states called fetters ( saṃyojana ). He 
understands that with the presence of these fetters, it is impossible to cross the 
shore. Therefore, the practitioner, by the four stages of supramundane state, 
eliminates those 10 fetters and attain s arahathood. These 10 fetters are as follows: 
personality view ( sakkāyadiṭṭhi ), perplexity ( vicikicch ā), indulgence in wrongful 
rites and rituals ( sīlabbatapar āmāsa), Sensual desire ( kāmarāga), hatred 
(paṭigha ), attachment to the material sphere ( rūparāga), attachment to the 
immaterial sphere ( arūparāga), conceit ( māna), restlessness ( uddhacca ), and 
ignorance ( avijjā). Among them, the first five are collectively called as lower 
(orammabh āgiya) fetters and the last five are known as higher 
(uddhammabh āgiya) fetters . 
THE FOUR STAGE S OF SUPRAMUNDANE STATE  
The four stages are:  
1. Stream entry ( sotāpatti)  
2. Once -returning ( sakad āgāmi)  
3. Non-returning ( anāgāmi)  
4. Arahat  
In this way, there are four types of individuals called stream enterer, once -
returner, non -returner, and arahat. Each of the four stages can be divided into two 
substages: the path ( magga ) and fruit ( phala ). 
Accordingly t he consciousness of each individual is called path consciousness 
(maggacitta ) or fruition consciousness ( phalacitta ) with respect to the sub-stage . 
A practitioner eliminates all the respective fetters in the path stage and in the 
fruiting stage he realises the cessation of fetters.   8 Stages  and elimination of fetters  
Stream entry  eliminates the first three 
fetters  
Once -returning  suppresses or weakens the 
fourth and fifth fetters  
Non-returning  eliminates both the fetters, 
which ha ve been suppressed 
at the state of once -returning  
Arahat  eliminates the last five fetters  
 
The fruit of stream -enterer  (sotāpatti-phala ) 
Having been uprooted the first three fetters, the stream -enterer has three 
possibilities of rebirth  after his death . First, he takes maximum of seven births in 
the human and celestial world and liberates himself in any of the rebirths. 
Although one does not remember that he is sotāpanna  in his subsequent births , it 
is said that by the previous kamma effect one gains im plicit confidence in triple 
gems and observes five precepts.  Secondly he takes rebirth in good families and 
attains arahathood within two or three rebirths. Lastly, a specially developed 
person ( ekab īji puggala ) takes only single birth. How fast a practit ioner attains 
Arahathood depends on one’s individual mental elevation.  
The fruit of once -returner  (sakad āgāmi-phala ) 
Since the individual in the second stage takes rebirth only once, he is called 
sakad āgāmī. Moreover, the commentary on Puggalapaññatti  also mentions five 
types of once returner . [Bodhi 2000, 361]  
The fruit of non -returner  (anāgāmi-phala ) 
As the name suggests, the non -returner does not take rebirth to any sensuous 
planes. He has now completely abandoned sensual lust and hatred. He 
spontan eously takes rebirth in the pure abodes ( suddh āvāsa bh ūmī) and attains 
arahathood there. Abhi VT mentions five types of non -returner.  [Bodhi 2000, 362]  
The fruit of Arahat  
Having destroyed all the defilements , one attains arahatship or Sop ādhisesa 
Nibb āna and becomes the destroyer of all cankers ( khīṇāsava). This is the state of 
intuitive or inferential  knowledge ( paṭivedhañ āṇa or anubodhañ āṇa), which is  9 neither nothingness nor mere cessation. Now, the individual is free from the cycle 
of existence. These supramundane paths and fruits are attained by the method 
called Vipassan ā bhāvanā by developing the faculty of wisdom ( paññindriya ). 
Having done so, one realises the threefold characteristics —impermanence, 
miserable, and substance -less— of all the phenomen a.
